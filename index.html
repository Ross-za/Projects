        <p>Hey hey hey! My name is Ross Thomas and I am from Johannesburg, South Africa. 
            To be honest I am a litt nervous about this course as I last touched any programming like 4 years ago and that was an intro to Python course.
            I have enjoyed this week so far and learned a lot. Im looking forward to the rest of this block.

        <p>South Africa is one of the most diverse and culturally rich countries in the world. Sadly, like many countries today, it is riddled with governmental corruption which 
            destroys the poorer communities and pushes out the wealthy. The Western Cape is one of 9 provinces and is one of the only efficiently run province, but we hope to see 
            dramatic change with this next election.</p>
